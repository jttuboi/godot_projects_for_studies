The code is based in some tutorial or used for tests.

If the code is based in any tutorial, that code has the same License than
tutorial.
If that tutorial doesn't have any License, the code has MIT License.

Other code developed by me is under MIT License.

I just ask to reference my github project in case of used for anything.
